Errors encountered
The first error was getting the css after using laravel-mix to compile the css files due to response from browser as html

The controllers should be placed in diff files.
Controller means the logic for the validation or anything 
its a factory function
in web.js we are calling the controllers object's index method which will be having the params req and res passed.

connect mongo used to store the sessions in the database.
we cannot pass object directly in data attribute so we are converting to JSON and then to string and passing and in JS we are getting back that value.

flash messages are only for single requests.

Place the passport.session() initialisation after the session because nodejs excecutes from top to bottom and couldn't find the user as session are set after it.
Href is used to make cursor pointer in Logout anchor tag
